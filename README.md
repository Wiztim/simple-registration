# Simple Registration
* This was a CS 1 final project I made on 5/26/21

## Building
* This uses C++
* A folder named "passwords" must exist in the same directory of the source file
* Files will be created in /passwords and a file named "users.txt" will be made in the same folder as the source.

## Current Features
* Signing up as a user with a password.
* Signing in.
* Modifying your password.
